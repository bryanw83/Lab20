        <p>Bryan has always loved gaming, hunting, music and movies. While he's been fortunate enough
          to have traveled to many places in the US, he has never really spent any time outside of
          the country. One day he hopes to visit Scotland to see his ancestors' home.
        </p>

        <p>In October of 2018, Bryan began learning Javva development as well as HTML and CSS at Grand Circus
          in Detroit. Below you can find links to his 'LinkedIn' profile, as well as his 'GitHub' page
          and a link to the 'Grand Circus' website.</p>

        <p>Bryan has been a resident of Detroit his entire life. He lives in the 'Old Redford' area northwest
        of the city.</p>
